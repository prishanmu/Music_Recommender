# Content-Based Music Recommender System

**Motivation & Purpose**

Taking inspiration from a [Netflix recommendation system](https://www.kaggle.com/niharika41298/netflix-visualizations-recommendation-eda/notebook#Recommendation-System-(Content-Based)) on Kaggle, I wanted to create a music artist recommendation system.

I have been looking at 3 different ways to create this system: 
* Content-Based Rec System based on lyrics
* Content-Based Rec System based on song/musical properties
* Collaborative Filtering Rec System

**Data Source**

* AZ Lyrics data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/albertsuarez/azlyrics, the scraping code can be found here: https://github.com/AlbertSuarez/azlyrics-scraper
* Spotify data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks
* Dataset for collaborative filtering: https://www.kaggle.com/rymnikski/dataset-for-collaborative-filters

**Files in Repo**

* AZ_Lyrics_Recommendation_System.ipynb
* Spotify_Recommendation_System.ipynb
* coming soon: Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendation_System.ipynb
